    "It is a UHC minigame for Minecraft servers, a plugin that combines UHC parts from all servers. I wanted to combine all my favorite parts of UHC from multiple servers. You can customize what you want. A lot of time and effort went into this minigame. I would really appreciate your feedback. I will try to improve this minigame as much as I can. Thank you and enjoy!",
